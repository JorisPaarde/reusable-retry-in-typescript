    <h1>Reusable retry in TypeScript forked</h1>

    <p>
      We communicate with many third-party service providers that, sadly, don’t
      have the best track record. We never assume a third party to be up 100% of
      the time, so we must handle occasional request failures. One way of
      handling service interruptions is simply retrying the operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple (but admittedly naive) retry function could be implemented like
      the one in <b>"src/retryFn.ts"</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      This function takes the function that is to be retried as its first
      argument, and some additional options as its second. As long as there are
      tries available the given function will be called and retried until either
      the function returns a result, or we run out of tries. Either the result
      of the function or the last error it throws are exposed to the outside
      world.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        A) Type this function so there are no type errors and that any function
        that doesn’t require any arguments can be retried. The return type of
        the original function must be preserved, wrapped in a promise.
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>
        B) Complete the unit tests in "retryFn.test.ts" and test all code paths.
      </b>
      <i>
        You can run tests by going to the Tests tab. Tests are written in the 
        <b>"retryFn.test.ts"</b> file using jest:
